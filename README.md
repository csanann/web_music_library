# Music Library test-driving CRUD routes in a Sinatra Application
The project focuses on building and testing CRUD routes in a Sinatra web application that interacts with a database. The goal is to practice TDD while implementing routes to create, read, update and delete resources.

## What we did
I implemented and test-drove the following routes for managing artists and albums:
- 'GET /artists': Returns the list of artist
- 'POST /artists': Creates a new artist and returns 200 OK
I also created a sequence diagram to explain the behavior of the program when a request is sent to 'POST /artist'.

## Conclusion
By following the TDD approach, I was able to ensure the correctness, maintainability, and readability of mine code. The project helped me gain a deeper understanding of CRUD operations, RESTful routing patterns, and working with database-backed classes in a Sinatra application.
